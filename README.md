# Cadov.js
Cadov.js (pronounced CAY-dov) is a browser-based game engine that runs in an HTML canvas. Although other JavaScript libraries have been built to do this before, Cadov is designed with simplicity in mind. It's built for simple 2D games without any heavy physics involved.

As of now, Cadov is pre-alpha, meaning many of the features I plan to implement are incomplete or nonexistent

# Version 0.1.0 (Pre-alpha Release)
Cadov is now available for anyone who wants to download and build it themselves. It's written in Typescript, and so needs to be compiled through Webpack. No NPM release is currently available, but one is planned for the alpha release. Docs are a work in progress, but will be released here when ready
